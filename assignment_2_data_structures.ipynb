Lists are generally preferred for collections of items that are expected to change frequently, offering methods for modification like append() and remove().

In the rare worst-case scenario, often due to many hash collisions, access could degrade to linear time, O(n), but Python's highly optimized hash function design minimizes this.

This meant that the order in which items were inserted was not guaranteed during retrieval or iteration. However, from Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries do maintain insertion order, so while they are not inherently sorted by key or value, they are no longer \"unordered\" in the traditional sense of not preserving sequence. This change means that now, when iterating or retrieving items, we can rely on the order in which they were added, but they still don't offer positional indexing like lists."

Dictionaries, on the other hand, retrieve data by associating unique keys with values (e.g., my_dict['city_name']), providing extremely fast average O(1) lookup based on the key.
